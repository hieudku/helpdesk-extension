HelpdeskAI – Privacy Policy

Effective Date: 10/2/2025

HelpdeskAI is a Chrome extension created for students and staff to easily connect with an AI helpdesk. We respect your privacy and are committed to being transparent about how your information is handled.

1. Information We Collect

User Input: When you type a question into the HelpdeskAI extension, your text is sent securely to the school’s AI backend server for processing.

No Personal Data: We do not request, collect, or store personally identifiable information such as names, emails, addresses, or passwords.

2. How We Use Information

Your input is only used to generate an AI-powered response to your query.

The data is not used for advertising, profiling, or any unrelated purposes.

3. Data Storage

User inputs are processed in real time.

We do not permanently store your input in the extension.

The school’s backend AI server may temporarily process your query for technical reasons, but no personal profiles are created.

4. Data Sharing

We do not sell, share, or transfer user data to third parties.

Data is only exchanged with the school’s AI backend system for the sole purpose of providing helpdesk responses.

5. User Control

You can stop using HelpdeskAI at any time by uninstalling the extension from your browser.

Since we do not collect or store personal data, there is no data to delete.

6. Security

All communications between the extension and the school’s backend are transmitted securely over HTTPS.

7. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy if the extension changes. Any updates will be posted publicly.
